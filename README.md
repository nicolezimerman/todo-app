_Create a simple Todo List application using React._

--> The app should allow users to add(OK), edit(OK), and delete(OK) tasks.

- Each task should have a title, description, and a completion status.
- Users should be able to mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Styling the application to make it visually appealing is also part of the assignment.
